# Project Steps:

## 1. try to exit!

Create a while loops that only breaks when
a user types exit or quit

## 2. ask a question

Create a while loop that continuously asks a
simple question.

## 3. ask only once.

Create a while loop that asks a question once
and then goes to a standard prompt.

## 4. ask many questions.

Create a while loop that asks several questions
then goes to a standard prompt.

## 5. ask many questions using 1 if statement.

Take your code and refactor it so that 
it uses only one if statement to ask many questions.

## 6. ask many questions, ask one question many times.

Create a while loop that asks several questions.  One 
of those questions should be asked 5 times.

## 7. back and worth...

Create a while loop that asks two questions one after
another in a repeated fashion.  

Question: What is your name?
Question: where do you work?
Question: What is your name?
Question: Where do you work?
....

## 8. Create a game with 6 questions.  Each question can lead 
to another question based on choices.  You can only break 
the loop with 2 of the 6 questions.  If the person is on the other 
4 questions, it must switch it to another question.

Case 1:
Doctor: Do you have a fever? Yes
Doctor: Do you have a cough? Yes
Doctor: Do you need medicine? Yes
Doctor: Do you want an extra dose? Yes
Doctor: That will be $500? Yes
exits

Case 2:
Doctor: Do you have a fever? No
Doctor: Are you sure? Yes
exits

Case 3:
Doctor: Do you have a fever? no
Doctor: Are you sure? No
Doctor: Do you want medicine? No
Doctor: Are you sure? No
Doctor: Do you want medicine? yes
Doctor: Do you want an extra dose? yes
Doctor: That will be $500? no
Doctor: Are you sure? yes
Exits

6 Question.  You can only exit on:
1. That will be $500! with a yes answer.
2. Are you sure? with a yes answer.

## 9.  Redo the game, but make sure to not use a single integer 
or long variable.  You must use only string variables to switch
questions.  You must use the break keyword to get out.

## 10. create your own game and blog about it.  
Make it as complex as you would like.  You can have 0 rules, 100 rules or anything in between.  You could have people select answers.  A good one would be a old dungeon crawler game where you describe each
room that you go into.
